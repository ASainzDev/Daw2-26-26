Back in 2006, I was studying at an English academy for a few months.
One day, while we were having dinner in a restaurant, one of my classmates suggested that we should go to London, just for fun. Nobody said yes at that moment, but a few days later we all agreed to go on the trip. Two weeks later, we were getting on a plane. Two hours later, we arrived in London.

We stayed for four days during the Easter holidays. Because we planned the trip so fast, three of us stayed in a small hotel and the other three stayed two streets away. Every morning, we were calling each other to meet.

The weather in London was crazy. Early in the morning, it was cold and rainy, like winter. Around noon, it was sunny, like spring. In the evening, it was windy and cold again, like autumn.

On the first day, we did what every tourist usually does when they visit London: we went to see Big Ben. I had to ask for directions several times, and it was a great opportunity to practise my English. Then we walked through Trafalgar Square. There were people everywhere you looked. While we were there, someone suggested that we should go to Buckingham Palace. It was not planned for that day, but we decided to go anyway.

On the second day, someone said that he wanted to ride the London Eye. It was huge and very expensive. There were a lot of people in the queue. While we were waiting, someone said that we did not have enough time if we wanted to visit other places, so we left. After that, we went to the British Museum. It is an amazing place. We went to take a picture of the Rosetta Stone. Many tourists were pushing each other to reach the best spot. When I was taking my picture, a shorter tourist behind me gave me his camera, so I was taking a picture for him with one hand while I was taking another picture for myself with the other.

That evening, we went shopping in Oxford Street. I bought an Arsenal shirt for a friend of mine while the rest of the group were deciding what to buy.

On the last day, we decided to visit Harrods. Everything there was luxury. You could buy almost anything: not only clothes and expensive things, but also food. There were even travel agencies inside, and there was a car for sale. I did not have enough money, not even for the wheels. The security guards were dressed very elegantly, with black suits and white gloves. One of them followed us for a few minutes just to tell us that we had to carry our bags in our hands.

That same night, we took a small bus to the airport. The flight was scheduled for six in the morning, so we were looking for something to do while we were waiting. The funny part was that we were trying to sleep at the airport, but none of us succeeded. However, the moment we got on the plane, we all fell asleep.

It was a very nice trip.
